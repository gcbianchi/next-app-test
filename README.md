Today we are playing with Pokémon!

We are making a Pokédex Next App to list our favorite Pokémon out there.
We'll be catching our Pokémon from the awesome pokeapi.co API.

Part 1: Listing

- Upon loading the home page, the first 20 Pokémon are retrieved and listed by the server
- The list is displayed horizontally and each Pokémon is displayed with its name and sprite image
- The button 'Get more' can be clicked to retrieve and list more Pokémon

Part 2: Grouping

- We now want to group Pokémon based on their respective 'height'
- Each group is displayed vertically and displays its list of Pokémon as mentioned in Part 1
- The button 'Change grouping' can be clicked to cycle through all the grouping criteria (height, weight, types)
- Pokémon having multiple types will appear in each corresponding group
